## JavaScript Hierarchy and Loading

Q: How does JavaScript file loading work in HTML?
A: JavaScript files are loaded and executed in the order they appear in HTML. Later scripts can override functions/variables from earlier scripts, with the last definition "winning".

Q: What is the hierarchy of JavaScript code execution?
A: The hierarchy from highest to lowest precedence is:
1. Inline JavaScript (in HTML attributes)
2. Internal JavaScript (in <script> tags)
3. External JavaScript (in separate .js files)

Example:
```html
<!-- 1. Inline JavaScript (highest) -->
<button onclick="doSomething()">Click</button>

<!-- 2. Internal JavaScript -->
<script>
  function doSomething() { }
</script>

<!-- 3. External JavaScript (lowest) -->
<script src="/js/scripts.js"></script>
```

Q: How is JavaScript hierarchy different from CSS?
A: Unlike CSS which merges styles:
- JavaScript uses execution order rather than cascading
- Functions can be completely redefined
- Event listeners stack instead of overriding
- Page-specific scripts can override global scripts
